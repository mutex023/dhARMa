This is a hobby ARM operating system project for BeagleBone Black
being written from scratch. This is going to be a life long
project to gain inner satisfaction and learn a lot about embedded OS programming.

Get the ARM cross compiler toolchain from here : https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded

The TI AM335x Cortex A8 (Sitara) Technical Ref. manual (TRM) is very much required.

As is the BBB Sys. Ref. manual (SRM)

The following documents are required to code/understand ARM assembly:

[1] ARM System Developers Guide

[2] ARM Cortex A series programmers guide - http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.den0013d/index.html

[3] ARM v7-A Architecture Reference Manual - http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0406c/index.html
