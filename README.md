This is a hobby ARM operating system project for BeagleBone Black
being written from scratch. This is going to be a life long
project to gain inner satisfaction and learn a lot about embedded OS programming.

Get the ARM cross compiler toolchain from here : https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded

TI AM335x Cortex A8 (Sitara) Technical Ref. manual (TRM) is very much required.

As is the BBB Sys. Ref. manual (SRM)

A copy of the ARM System Developers Guide is also required to understand ARM assembly.
