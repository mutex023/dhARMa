G1\r\n\r\nThis is a hobby ARM operating system project for BeagleBone Black\r\nbeing written from scratch. This is going to be a life long\r\nproject to gain inner satisfaction and learn a lot about embedded OS programming.\r\n\r\nGet the ARM cross compiler toolchain from here : https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded\r\n\r\nTI AM335x Cortex A8 (Sitara) Technical Ref. manual (TRM) is very much required.\r\n\r\nAs is the BBB Sys. Ref. manual (SRM)\r\n\r\nA copy of the ARM System Developers Guide is also required to understand ARM assembly.\r\nOr better still use the ARM Cortex A series programmers guide - http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.den0013d/index.html\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
